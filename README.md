## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the encryption system, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system integrates a quantum computing framework, implements a Quantum Key Distribution system, develops and implements post-quantum encryption algorithms, utilizes multi-threading and multiprocessing for high-performance parallel processing, implements quantum-resistant cryptographic techniques, manages and stores cryptographic keys securely, and provides a user-friendly interface for data encryption and decryption.

## Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python test.py
```

The tests include security audits and penetration testing to ensure the system's robustness against various attack vectors.

## Performance Metrics

To measure the system's encryption speed and security strength, run the following command:

```bash
python performance_metrics.py
```

## Patent Application

If patentable features are identified, the patent application process can be initiated by running the following command:

```bash
python patent_application.py
```
